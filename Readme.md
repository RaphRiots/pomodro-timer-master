## Documentation
I was looking in the Internet for a simple but functional Pomodoro Timer, 
after countless hours of looking at the Code, I noticed that alot of them use 
different JS codeds and "plug-ins" wich I didnt know, or reconised. 

Finaly, on my last Breath if found this Video of Guy wich makes a Timer with
Vanilla JS, CSS and HTML. He explaind it pretty good, even I could understand
what he was talking about. 

Fastforward I made it happen and tweaked around,till it satisfied my Needs. 
After a strange Error, in wich i put a div into a Form Container it worked all well again. 

So here it is. My Pomodoro Timer with Audio (Hey Listen.)
